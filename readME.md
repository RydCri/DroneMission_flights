### WIP

<h3>DroneMission Component: Mission Builder</h3>
<br>
This repository tracks the development of a component for integration into the DroneMission project.
<br>
https://github.com/RydCri/DroneMission/
<br>
This component provides users of the webapp with tools to:
<br>

<ul>
<li>Sync drones using MAVProxy and Ardupilot.</li>
<li>Choose autonomous flight missions.</li>
<li>Output files based on mission type.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Your Drone will be connected by wifi to your ground station device where you will be able to build and task your drone for the desired missions.
<br>
The application's focus is on generating maps, orthomosaics, and photogrammetry (3D models) using FPV and gimbal camera drones.
