<h3>DroneMission Component: Mission Builder</h3>
<br>
This repository tracks the development of a component for integration into the DroneMission project.
<br>
https://github.com/RydCri/DroneMission/
<br>
This component provides users of the webapp with tools to:
<br>

<ul>
<li>Sync drones using MAVProxy and Ardupilot.</li>
<li>Choose autonomous flight missions.</li>
<li>Output files based on mission type.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Your Drone will be connected by 900MHz or 2.4GHz RF to your ground station device where you will be able to build and task your drone for the desired missions.
<br>
The application's focus is on generating maps, orthomosaics, and photogrammetry using FPV and gimbal camera drones.

<p>The app is intended for minimal latency mission maintenance to ensure drones stay on course, have immediate access to manual control and contingencies like RTL or remedial comm protocols.</p>
<p>Once mission is complete: collected files will be uploadable to build projects related to mission type.</p>
